1. Make and female graduate enrollment (1967 - 2015). Compare trends in total graduate enroll- ment for males and females (including full-time/part-time and private/public universities) in the United States from 1967 - 2015. Describe your results statistically, graphically and in text.


```{r}
# eliminate the for profit and non profit section of private univserities
grad_enrollment1<-grad_enrollment %>% 
  select(-Private_Nonprofit, -`Private_For-Profit`)

grad_enrollment1

# exploratory graphs for male and female totals
explore_graph_male<- ggplot(grad_enrollment1, aes(x = Total_Males, y = Year))+
  geom_point()
explore_graph_male
# male totals appear linear
explore_graph_female<- ggplot(grad_enrollment1, aes(x= Total_Females, y = Year))+
  geom_point()
explore_graph_female
# female totals appear linear
explore_graph_male_hist<- ggplot(grad_enrollment1, aes(x = Total_Males))+
  geom_histogram()
explore_graph_male_hist
# male totals appear normal
explore_graph_female_hist<- ggplot(grad_enrollment1, aes(x = Total_Females))+
  geom_histogram()
explore_graph_female_hist
# female totals DO NOT appear normal
