1. Make and female graduate enrollment (1967 - 2015). Compare trends in total graduate enroll- ment for males and females (including full-time/part-time and private/public universities) in the United States from 1967 - 2015. Describe your results statistically, graphically and in text.

#RESEARCH QUESTION: Does gender effect college enrollment rate


# Create a data set of male and female total enrollments
# look into regressions between genders
# Create a graphic

# data set of only totals for males and females
